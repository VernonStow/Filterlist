# Grayware Filterlist
Blocklist for suspicious websites involved with tracking, spam, malware, or aggressive ad reinsertion. This list is meant to supplement mainstream blocklists.

Tested with uBlock Origin on latest Firefox browser. It should also work with Chromium-based browsers and with AdGuard extension.

Contributions are welcome. Criteria: domain is not listed in mainstream filter lists and has one or more of these traits: (1) used in spam or phishing campaigns, especially on social media, (2) unexpected redirects (as from expired domains), (3) aggressive ads or popups that evade uBlockOrigin, (4) fake virus warnings and tech support scams, (5) appears in lists of abused domains from reputable antimalware sources, or (6) attempts to perform a drive-by download. Ordinary unblocked ads and anti-adblock domains should be reported to mainstream list maintainers such as EasyList or uAssets as desribed here: https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets
