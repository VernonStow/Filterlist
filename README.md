# Grayware Filterlist
Blocklist for suspicious websites involved with tracking, spam, malware, or aggressive ad reinsertion. This list is meant to supplement mainstream blocklists.

Tested with uBlock Origin on latest Firefox browser. It should also work with Chromium-based browsers and with AdGuard extension.

Criteria for adding domains: domain not listed in mainstream filter lists and at least one of the following: (1) observed in social-media spam or phishing campaigns, (2) unexpected redirects (as from expired domains), (3) aggressive ads or popups that evade uBlockOrigin, (4) fake virus warnings and tech support scams, (5) appears in lists of abused domains (e.g., IOC lists) from reputable antimalware sources, or (6) apparent phishing, scams, or unexpected downloads. Ordinary unblocked ads and anti-adblock domains should be reported to mainstream list maintainers such as EasyList or uAssets as desribed here: https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets
